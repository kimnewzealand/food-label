# What the Label

## Food Label Information

Food labeling can be confusing and hard to read, with the small numbers and text in the Nutrition Label Information table. Additionally ingredients lists can be long, and also written in small text. This information can be difficult to process on the go and without a reference point.

## Goal

The purpose of the website is to visualise food labelling data from food packaging to make this process of interpretation easier. It is not however intended to provide nutritional advice.

## Data

Nutrition data is available from the [Ministry of Health](https://www.health.govt.nz/nz-health-statistics/health-statistics-and-data-sets/nutrition-data-and-stats).

Plant & Food Research and the Ministry of Health jointly own the [New Zealand Food Composition Database](https://www.foodcomposition.co.nz/).  This database source provides a comprehensive collection of nutrition information panel data as seen on food managing.

The FOODfiles™ Data is available subject to the FOODfiles™ Data Licensing [terms](https://www.foodcomposition.co.nz/terms/).
